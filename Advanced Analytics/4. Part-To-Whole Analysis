- 	This is a technique that is used to compare an indivdual's contribution to a whole. Here I will analyze how an individual part
	is performing with respect the the whole. This will enable me to know which category has the greatest/least impact to the business.
    (Proportion of a part relative to the whole)
      
Clause: ([Measure] / Total [Measure]) x 100 by [Dimension]
		i.e. 	(sales / total sales) x 100 by Category
				(Quantity / Total Quantity) x 100 by Country

	- As I can see from the results of the above query, the 'Bikes Category' dominates with a contribution of 96.46%. The other 2 categories
      'Accessories' & 'Clothing' have negligible contribution as compared to 'Bikes' which is a dangerous thing in a business because this
      means that if anything bad would happen to the 'Bikes', the whole business would be in significant danger.
	- In order to address this issue, the business should consider either entirely getting rid of the negligible categories or come up with
      an aggressive marketing strategy for the products in those 2 categories in order to jumpstart their sales.
